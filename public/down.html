            <h5>Hi Ashmita</h5>
            <p class="down-body">It seems like you've been feeling down recently. 
                Maybe you didn't do as well as you hoped on that math test, or one of your friends hurt you. Maybe you are feeling depressed, betrayed, guilty. Thats ok.
                This is just to let you know that i'm always here for you. No matter what. You can always ask me if you need help or just a place to vent.
                As Micheal Jordan said, "I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying." Whatever it is that your upset about, I'm sure that you've 
                tried all you can to suceed. I know that your an incredibly dedicated and hard working person, and I admire you for that. If you haven't tried your best, then that's ok too.

                There is never a failure which will end everything. Maybe that's how it feels right now, but remember that there will always be new oppurtunities waiting for you; You just have to find them.
                So, maybe its time to sit down and cry for awhile. Then take some time for self care. Maybe watch harry potter (i know how much of a potterhead you are), do a chill dance or take a quick nap.
                When you feel better, and if you feel like some improvement could be made, then you can do a serious reflection on what went wrong. Failure is failure. It happened already. It's crippling and soul crushing, but there is nothing you can do to change the past.

                There is something you can do tho, to turn failure into success, to extract a valuable lesson from it. If you can do that, then thats enough. Ultimately, thats what we are right? just constantly failing and learning and failing and learning. 
                Thats how we improve.

                This was a bit corny and lecture-y, but i hope it helps. If you need a hug, remember i am always available.
                Sometimes when you feel bad about yourself it can be hard to keep in mind the positive qualities that make you a wonderful person.

                You have big beautiful eyes, a nice smile, and you are always available for me when i need you. Please dont forget that.

                - Andrew
